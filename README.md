# Multimediasystem Text Recognition

## Overview

In this project we are implementing a demo Android app, to show the working of
image to text recognition systems. We will use the [Google ML Kit](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/text-recognition) for text
recognition and implement two image filters to improve the recognition quality.
